# The value (stuff after the colon) is the "alias" which is used when checking for the DenyLink permission node.

This is an example sign for custom commands, read more in the Quick Reference (found in the plugins/SignShop folder).
    Class: The Class sign exchanges the customer's money and their inventory for the chest's items.  The 2nd and 3rd lines of this sign can say whatever you like, the price goes on the 4th.  Punch the chest(s) using !linkmaterial containing the type and amount of items you want for a single transaction.  Money is not put in the owner's account.
    Disenchant: The Disenchant sign exchanges the customer's money for removing the enchantment on the item in their hands.  The 2nd and 3rd lines of this sign can say whatever you like, the price goes on the 4th.  Money is not put in the owner's account.
    Command: The Command sign exchanges the customer's money to run the command on the sign. The 2nd and 3rd lines of this sign have the command written on them (without the "/"), the price goes on the 4th.  SignShop cannot know if the command was successfully completed, so it will take the customer's money even if the command doesn't work.
    UserCommand: The UserCommand sign exchanges the customer's money to run the command on the sign as if they typed it in. The 2nd and 3rd lines of this sign have the command written on them (without the "/"), the price goes on the 4th.  SignShop cannot know if the command was successfully completed, so it will take the customer's money even if the command doesn't work, or they don't have permission.
    Share: The Share sign is used to share profits with other users.  List other usernames on the 2nd and/or 3rd lines of the sign.  The percentage you would like to share goes on the 4th line.  If you list multiple people on the sign, you put both percentages on the 4th line, separated by a "/".  Any remaining money is given to the owner of the shop.  Punch this sign and then any active shop signs you own with !linkmaterial to activate.
    Restricted: The Restricted sign is used to make it so only certain permission groups can use a sign.  List the permission groups on the 2nd, 3rd, and/or 4th lines of the sign.  Punch this sign and then any active shop signs you own with !linkmaterial to activate.
