# You can also visit our Bukkit page at tiny.cc/SignShop

# There are a few basic options to modify how SignShop acts globally
# You can edit anything in this config and use "/signshop reload" to reload the config while the server is running


#----------- Admin Options ------------------

# Allow OP to have all permissions, regardless of permission settings (Default = true)

Languages: english

# Fetch more readable item names from the internet (Default = false)
EnableNamesFromTheWeb: false

#----------- Mechanics ------------------

# Below is a list of all the materials that SignShop will allow to be linked to a shop.
# The key (stuff before the colon) can either be the material name (http://jd.bukkit.org/rb/apidocs/org/bukkit/Material.html)
# or it can the ID. To only allow blocks with a specific data value, just attach a ~ with the damage value (ex. WOOL~4 or 35~4 for Yellow Wool)
# The value (stuff after the colon) is the "alias" which is used when checking for the DenyLink permission node.
# So before a player can link a CHEST, the player will be checked for OP (OP's can link everything from the list below) and the SignShop.DenyLink.chest permission node.
